                  From the outside we look like an average farming family and in most ways we are. We love spending time at the beach and teaching our children things about the world. But what sets us apart is that we have a passion to make a positive change to help everyone live the healthiest lifestyle possible and we can do this through producing goat milk and delivering it to the world.
