            <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
            <p>In the beginning of 2013 Lydia and Sean Baty started construction on their dream of building a goat farm. By 2014 this dream become a reality with a starting heard of 600 goats. Slowly with success and setbacks Tuki Tuki Dairy goats has grown to 2000 goats producing up to 7000 litres annually. 
I was lucky enough to have Lydia as my cousin and have had the privilege to work and experience this journey. For the last five years I have lived with my cousins. They were able to give not just a job also a home and a loving family. For the last 5 year I have been able to grow so much as a person. While working I have been able to learn the importance of hard work, taking initiative, independence and responsibility.
I will be forever be grateful for the opportunities and experiences they have given me. Therefore I found it very enjoyable while designing a brand for Tuki Tuki Dairy Goats. For the past 5 years the farm has been up and operational. Lydia and Sean have focused on building their farm to be fully working at optimum capacity. Luckily for me they did not create a permanent logo or branding which has given me an opportunity to create a unique, innovative design to express Tuki Tuki Dairy Goats as a growing enterprise.  I have enjoyed facing every challenge and success I have had designing there brand because it was a way i was able to do what i love, which is design and give back to Lydia and Sean for taking me into their family and giving me amazing learning opportunities that I will forever benefit from.</p>
