            <h1>THE LOGO</h1>
            <p>A logo is a key importance to any company branding especially to an enterprise what would be producing many different products which target many demographics throughout the market. Because it shows the relationship between the products and how they have been produced by the same company, this is helpful to determine if customers who enjoy one of the products produced by Tuki Tuki Dairy Goats might entice these customers to try and purchase the other goat milk based products produced by this farm.

           <h3>WHERE IT FINSHED</h3>
           <p>My logo is monochromatic but I developed different colour versions so as to stand out on any background colour to attract the focus and attention of the targeted market. There is a risk different coloured logos could be less associated with other advertising and products from Tuki Tuki Dairy Goats but I decided to go with a logo where switching the colours around to suit the background eliminates any restrictions of where I can and cannot place my design, hence avoiding any risk of my logo blending in with the background.
           The final logo contains my goat character head. Additionally, I created a 2nd similar logo without this character to allow for more flexibility which means if I needed a logo for a design with a more mature and elegant feel that would not require the cheeky, cute, child-friendly goat character. After slightly rearranging the typography to have a more balanced space, I have used this in my design work. 

           I like that this logo shows a family friendly approach promoting a day care which I feel is ideal because that is also the same market I am targeting. I have used a similar calligraphy style font to create the naturally flowing effect as seen in my artist model. However, I chose a more rough, scruffier font because I find this font fits better with advertising a farm. I chose to use my logo with a side view head as I find this angle shows more of the goatâ€™s cheeky smile and balances better with the wording. </p>
